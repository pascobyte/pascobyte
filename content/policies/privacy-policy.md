This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you visit and use our website, pascobyte.blog. By visiting and using our website, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.

## Personal Information Collection

We collect the following personal information voluntarily provided by users through our Google contact form: name and email. Additionally, we use Clicky.com analytics, which is GDPR-compliant and 100% opt-in. The analytics data is anonymized and not used by Clicky.

## Use of Personal Information

The collected name and email are used solely to respond to inquiries from users. Clicky analytics is used to find popular topics for creating engaging content, identifying issues like broken links and flow problems, and addressing scaling issues on certain screens.

## Data Protection Measures

The personal information is accessible only to the website owner and is secured with two-factor authentication. All data is stored in the website owner's personal Google Drive, protected with Google's internal security system.

## Sharing of Personal Information

Name and email information are not shared with any third parties unless required by legal representatives in the event of legal issues. However, the analytics data is sent to Clicky's servers, as mentioned in their documentation, but it remains anonymized and not used by Clicky.

# Cookie Policy

## Use of Cookies and Similar Technologies

Currently, our website does not use any cookies or similar technologies. We do not employ cookies for tracking, advertising, or any other purpose. Any future use of cookies, such as those for advertisements or affiliate links, will be handled through a special message that allows users to set and manage their preferences accordingly.

## Clicky Analytics Opt-In

To provide users with the option to enable Clicky analytics, we utilize one local storage item. This local storage item retains your analytics preference for one day, after which it will be removed. This allows you to re-choose your analytics choice during subsequent visits to our website.

Please note that Clicky analytics itself does not use cookies, ensuring compliance with our commitment to data privacy and security.
