This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you visit and use our website, pascobyte.blog. By visiting and using our website, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy. Please note that this website is intended for individuals aged 16 and above.

## Personal Information Collection

We collect the following personal information voluntarily provided by users through our Google contact form:

- Name
- Email

We may also collect feedback from users through our Google form. This feedback is optional and is used to improve our blog. We will only keep this feedback for as long as it is necessary to improve our blog. Once the feedback has been implemented, we will delete it from our records.

## Use of Personal Information

The collected name, email, and social media information is used solely to respond to inquiries from users. The feedback collected through our Google form is used to improve our blog. The lawful basis for processing this data is the user's consent.

## Data Protection Measures

The personal information is accessible only to the website owner and is secured with two-factor authentication. All data is stored in the website owner's personal Google Drive, protected with Googleâ€™s internal security system.

## Data Retention

Personal data is retained for a period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

## Sharing of Personal Information

Name, email are not shared with any third parties unless required by legal representatives in the event of legal issues. However, the feedback collected through our Google form is not shared with any third parties.

## International Data Transfers

If personal data is transferred outside the EU, appropriate safeguards are put in place to ensure the security of the data. Microsoft Clarity does transfer data from the EU. 

However, Microsoft ensures that any customer data transfers outside of the EU Data Boundary are protected by security safeguards detailed in their services agreements. 

Microsoft cloud services are built, operated, kept secure, and maintained by expert teams from around the world to provide customers with the highest level of service quality, support, security, and reliability. 

In rare cases when a service is down or in need of a repair that can't be effectuated with automated tooling, authorized Microsoft personnel may require remote access to data stored within the EU Data Boundary, including customer data. 

Microsoft uses a multilayered approach to protect customer data from unauthorized access by Microsoft personnel, which consists of both employees of Microsoft and its subsidiaries and contract staff from third party organizations who assist Microsoft employees. 

There's no default access to customer data; access is provided to Microsoft personnel only when a task requires it. 

Microsoft approached the EU Data Boundary with an imperative that it not compromise its ability to continue delivering industry-leading security to customers, but Microsoft still seeks to minimize the data that it must access or transfer outside of the EU Data Boundary to do this important work.
