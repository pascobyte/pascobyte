While our primary target audience is mature adults, there may be instances where we inadvertently collect personal information from children who visit and interact with our website. We may collect the following types of personal information from children:

- Email Address: Children may voluntarily provide their email address through our Google Contact Form or any other communication method.
- Other Information: In addition to the above, we may collect other information with the child's consent if they have opted-in to such data collection, for example, through Clicky Analytics.

## 2. Purpose of Information Collection

The personal information we collect from children is solely used for the following purposes:

- To respond to inquiries or requests submitted through our Google Contact Form.
- To improve our website and services by analyzing aggregated, non-personally identifiable data from Clicky Analytics if the child has opted-in.

## 3. Verifiable Parental Consent

We understand the importance of protecting the privacy and safety of children online. In compliance with COPPA, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children without obtaining verifiable parental consent. If we determine that a user is under the age of 13, we will seek verifiable parental consent before collecting any personal information, or we will promptly delete the information from our records.

## 4. Parental Review and Control

Parents or legal guardians have the right to review the personal information collected from their child, request its deletion, and prevent further collection or use. If you believe that we have collected personal information from your child without appropriate parental consent or have any inquiries regarding your child's data, please contact us at [Insert contact information].
